In Guile-SDL 0.5.0, there was a big renaming of symbols in various
enums and flags, part of the API overhaul.  This directory contains
sed scripts that essentially substitute the old symbols with the
new ones.

Usage is straightforward.  The safe way:

  sed -f SCRIPT FILE > FILE.NEW \
    && mv -f FILE.NEW FILE

The quick way (requires GNU sed or similar that takes ‘-i’):

  sed -f SCRIPT -i FILE

You can use a series of ‘-f SCRIPT’ arguments, as well.  See sed(1).

In any case, proper ordering is important to avoid aliasing problems.
In particular, it is important to apply evmask.sed BEFORE evtype.sed.
