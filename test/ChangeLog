	(debug?): New var, init from env var DEBUG.
	If non-#f, enable debug evaluator and backtrace on error.
	Also, if `debug?', display `sdl-get-video-info' alist.

	Split one `use-modules' into two for `(sdl sdl)' and `(sdl gfx)'.
	(debug?): New var, init from env var DEBUG.
	If non-#f, enable debug evaluator and backtrace on error.

	* mixer.scm: Rewrite header in modern-sh-wrapper style.
	In shell-script header, add check for env var
	HAVE_MIXER, and exit 77 as appropriate.
	No longer use module (ice-9 format).
	Split one `use-modules' into two for `(sdl sdl)' and `(sdl mixer)'.
