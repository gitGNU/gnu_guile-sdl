HACKING Guile-SDL                                               -*- org -*-

This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.
It lives in the repo but is not included in the distribution.

* ongoing (some of which may go into the next release)
*** use pre-installed SDL_gfx if sufficiently functional
    (alternatively, use the subset that is functional)
*** comment code (audience: intermediate scheme programmer)
*** make ‘set-colors!’ take optional arg ‘first’
*** likewise ‘set-palette’ (hmm, why does this not end in "!"?)
*** programming practice review
***** return values
******* smob safety
******* 0-means-success
******* consistency
*** /usr/include/SDL/*.h coverage
***** mixer
******* hooks
******* effects
*** ? opengl
*** ? interop w/ other event loops (fastevents, etc)
*** error handling cleanup
***** document policy
***** cases: NULL, -1, etc
*** many small modules: (sdl modules cdrom)
*** ? third-party post-install extension framework
*** performance tweaking
*** ? gnulib

* portability

* bootstrap tools
*** usual GNU stuff: Libtool, Autoconf, Automake
*** GNU Guile (see [[portability]] above)
*** SDL 1.2
*** [[http://www.gnuvola.org/software/guile-baux/][Guile-BAUX]]
*** [[http://www.gnuvola.org/software/snuggle/][SNUGGLE]]

* coding standards
*** C code: indent -nut
*** indent with emacs (don't like the result? fix emacs!)
*** (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
*** (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
*** everything UTF-8
*** assume ‘NULL’ is all bits zero
*** ChangeLog
***** ttn-style: TITLE LF LF {BLURB LF LF}* BODY
***** exclude titles suffixed "; nfc." (no functional change)

* copyright update policy
*** individual files only on change
*** individual years

* repo branch discipline
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** archive
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    (Since Guile-SDL is not so popular, we don't bother announcing it.)
*** q-TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
    These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
    to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.
*** z-TOPIC -- "zleeping, znoring, zoftly"
    These branches have changes that will never be part of a release.
    They are rebased every once in a while for exercise.
