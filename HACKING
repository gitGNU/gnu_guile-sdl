HACKING Guile-SDL                                               -*- org -*-

This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.
It lives in the repo but is not included in the distribution.

* 0.3.11
*** DONE upgrade to SDL_gfx 2.0.22
***** DONE add [[file:src/SDL_gfx/SDL_gfxPrimitives.h::thickLineColor][thick lines]] from 2.0.22
***** DONE add [[file:src/SDL_gfx/SDL_gfxPrimitives.h::gfxPrimitivesSetFontRotation][font rotation]] from 2.0.21
*** DONE remove ‘@node TODO’ from manual
*** DONE transition from ttn-fu to Guile-BAUX + SNUGGLE

* ongoing (some of which may go into the next release)
*** use pre-installed SDL_gfx if sufficiently functional
    (alternatively, use the subset that is functional)
*** comment code (audience: intermediate scheme programmer)
*** make ‘set-colors!’ take optional arg ‘first’
*** likewise ‘set-palette’ (hmm, why does this not end in "!"?)
*** programming practice review
***** return values
******* smob safety
******* 0-means-success
******* consistency
***** use unsigned long for colors
*** /usr/include/SDL/*.h coverage
***** mixer
******* hooks
******* effects
*** ? opengl
*** threading system
*** signals
*** ? interop w/ other event loops (fastevents, etc)
*** review/revise interfaces (WARNING: disruptive)
*** error handling cleanup
***** document policy
***** cases: NULL, -1, etc
*** handle pre-installed libSDL_gfx
***** write configure check for it
***** use it if it is featureful enough
*** many small modules: (sdl modules cdrom)
*** finalize interfaces
*** executable modules: (sdl scripts FOO)
*** third-party post-install extension framework
*** performance tweaking
*** user-alloc alternatives (less consing) for event procs
*** ? gnulib
*** switch to an automated wrapper generater

* portability
  | guile version | bootstrap | build | run |
  |     1.4.1.118 | yes       | yes   | yes |
  |     1.4.1.119 | yes       | yes   | yes |

* coding standards
*** C code: indent -nut
*** indent with emacs (don't like the result? fix emacs!)
*** (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
*** (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
*** everything UTF-8
*** ChangeLog
***** ttn-style: TITLE LF LF {BLURB LF LF}* BODY
***** exclude titles suffixed "; nfc." (no functional change)

* copyright update policy
*** individual files only on change
*** individual years

* repository branches
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** a -- "anchor", "asis", "already", "argh-just-leave-me-alone"
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    Guile-SDL hackers probably want to start here.
*** q-TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
    These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
    to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.
*** z-TOPIC -- "zleeping, znoring, zoftly"
    These branches have changes that will never be part of a release.
    It is rebased every once in a while for exercise.
