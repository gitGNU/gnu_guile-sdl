These are some basic examples of how to use Guile-SDL.  You can either
run them after installing Guile-SDL, or after building Guile-SDL by
setting the env var GUILE to include "-L DIR", where DIR is the absolute
name of the parent directory, something like:

	GUILE="guile -L `cd .. ; pwd`"
	export GUILE
