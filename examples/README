These are some basic examples of how to use guile-sdl.  You can either
run them after installing guile-sdl, or after building guile-sdl by
setting GUILE_LOAD_PATH to point to the top level sdl/ directory of
this distribution, and LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH to the src/ directories.

GUILE_LOAD_PATH=..
LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH=../src/.libs:../sdl-mixer/.libs:../sdl-ttf/.libs
