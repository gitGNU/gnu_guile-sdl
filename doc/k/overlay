Although these should be enums, these are putative flags
due to a limitation in the implementation@footnote{For
speed, we use immediate integers (aka @dfn{fixnums})
for enums, but those are not wide enough on a 32-bit
system to hold the overlay values.
Probably this should be rectified prior to release as
it represents a semi-regression.
OTOH, it's not like anyone is actually using
@code{create-yuv-overlay} anyway@dots{}}.
Procs that use them enforce enums-ish usage, anyway;
a list of symbols results in an error.
