Anonymous CVS is available for the "guile-sdl" module.
Here are the commands to use:

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.glug.org:/home/ttn/cvsroot login
	 # just type RET at the prompt

  cvs co guile-sdl

Look at autogen.sh to get started.

Here are some cvs tags and their meanings:

  ok-1   -- passes "make && make check"
  ok-2   -- like ok-1, plus doc snarfing (doc/guile-sdl.info available)
  ok-3   -- like ok-2, plus "make install" (w/ module catalog update)


Happy hacking!
