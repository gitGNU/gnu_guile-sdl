Around 2000 or 2001, each of Alex Shinn, Vikram Subramanian, and Joel Smith
either independently or loosely collaboratively, started writing Guile bindings
for the SDL library.  I asked Alex Shinn, who was starting to hack more with
Gauche than with Guile, for project maintenance duties and he agreed.  I have
not contacted the others, but instead fished their names out of the various
files found in the CVS repository tarball I received from Alex.
