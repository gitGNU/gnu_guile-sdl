Introduction
------------

This directory contains Guile-SDL, a set of modules that provide bindings
for SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) to enable Guile programmers to do all
the nice things you can do with SDL.

Most of the SDL functions have been wrapped with the exception of a few
functions that were too C-centric.  The SDL Threads and the Audio functions
haven't been included because of the problems with Guile code being run
from more than one thread.  However audio programming can be done with the
module `(sdl mixer)' that requires the SDL_mixer library.

Also included is SDL_gfx 2.0.18 (by Andreas Schiffler) and bindings for it.


Requirements
------------

* GNU gperf, if configuring w/ ‘--enable-maintainer-mode’
* Guile that
  can load binary module (a b c)
        from library file a/b/c.so on %load-path
* SDL-1.2
* SDL_image
* SDL_mixer (optional, required if audio support is needed)
* SDL_ttf (optional, required if truetype font support is needed)


Installation Process
--------------------

See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.  Briefly:

  ./configure [--disable-mixer] [--disable-ttf]
  make
  make check [INTERACTIVE=1] [DEBUG=1] [NOMMX=1]
  make install

By default, configuration tries to find the libSDL_mixer and libSDL_ttf
libs and headers to build modules (sdl mixer) and (sdl ttf), respectively.
If they are not found, these modules will not be installed.

Note: The output of "./configure --help" includes the line:
  --disable-sdltest       Do not try to compile and run a test SDL program
However, that option, an artifact of SDL's autoconf support, is ignored.

By default, "make check" runs only tests which do not require user
interaction.  You can specify `INTERACTIVE=1' to enable running these
particular tests.  If there are problems, add `DEBUG=1' and send the
output to the maintainer along w/ a precise description of observations
and expectations (i.e. file a bug report).

If the gfx test segfaults, try running it with `NOMMX=1'.


Installation Result
-------------------

Doing "make install" copies four compiled modules (machine-dependent
shared object libraries), two scheme modules (human readable text), and an
info file to various directories under ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}.  See
the file INSTALL if you wish to choose different values for the ${} vars.

      ${prefix}/info                 -- guile-sdl.info
   ${exec_prefix}/lib/guile/site/sdl -- (sdl sdl)
                                        (sdl mixer)
                                        (sdl ttf)
                                        (sdl gfx)
                                        (sdl misc-utils)
                                        (sdl simple)

Additionally, if your system supports "guile-tools make-module-catalog",
that program is run in both "site" directories to create and/or update the
module catalogs there.
