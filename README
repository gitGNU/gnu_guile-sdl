Introduction
------------

This directory contains guile-sdl, a set of modules that provide bindings for
SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) to enable Guile programmers to do all the nice
things you can do with SDL.

Most of the SDL functions have been wrapped with the exception of a few
functions that were too C-centric.  The SDL Threads and the Audio funcions
haven't been included because of the problems with Guile code being run from
more than one thread.  However audio programming can be done with the module
`(sdl mixer)' that requires the SDL_mixer library.

Also included are SDL_gfxPrimitives-1.4 and SDL_rotozoom-1.4
(by A. Schiffler  <aschiffler@home.com>) and bindings for them.


Requirements
------------

* Guile
* SDL-1.2
* SDL_image
* SDL_mixer (optional, required if audio support is needed)
* SDL_ttf (optional, required if truetype font support is needed)


Installation
------------

See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.  Briefly:

  ./configure [--disable-mixer] [--disable-ttf]
  make
  make check [INTERACTIVE=1]
  make install

By default, configuration tries to find the libSDL_mixer and libSDL_ttf
libs and headers to build modules (sdl mixer) and (sdl ttf), respectively.
If they are not found, these modules will not be installed.

By default, "make check" runs only tests which do not require user
interaction.  You can specify `INTERACTIVE=1' to enable running these
particular tests.
