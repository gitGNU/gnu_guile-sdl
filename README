The guile-sdl package is a meta-package.  It contains all files
and machinery to create a Guile sdl module, with inital support
for C code shared object modules, Scheme modules, a complete
distribution layout and a manual skeleton.

How to get started:
-------------------

In this example, we suppose that you wish to create a package called
`guile-foo', providing the module (foo foo).

Unpack the tarballs, copy the contents of this directory somewhere
else, and rename it.

  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): tar xzf guile-sdl-0.0.1.tar.gz 
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): mv guile-sdl-0.0.1 guile-foo
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x/guile-foo): 

Now change into that directory and start the `convert.sh' script,
which will rename several files and substitute your package name in
various places.

  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): cd guile-foo/
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x/guile-foo): ./convert.sh foo
  Renaming to foo...
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x/guile-foo): 

Now the package has been renamed and is ready for trying to build it.
Do not forget to run `autogen.sh' before configuring.

  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x/guile-foo): ./autogen.sh 
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x/guile-foo): ./configure
  creating cache ./config.cache
  checking for a BSD compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
  ...
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x/guile-foo): make
  guile-snarf -DPACKAGE=\"guile-foo\" -DVERSION=\"0.0.1\"  -I. -I.    -Wall -pedantic -ansi foo.c > foo.x \
  || { rm foo.x; false; }
  ...

You now have the compiled module in the .libs subdirectory and we can
try if everything worked fine.  Trying out is a bit complicated,
because we have not yet installed the package, but with a bit
symlinking and environment fiddling, we can do it.

Go to the directory above and make a symlink from your module name to
the package directory.  This step is required to make Guile search in
the right place for our Scheme module.

  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x/guile-foo): cd ..
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): ln -s guile-foo/ foo
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): 

Now we have to set up the environment to tell Guile where to find the
compiled portion of the module.

  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): export LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/mgrabmue/cvs/x/guile-foo/.libs/
  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): 

Let's go for it.

  mgrabmue@tortoise (~/cvs/x): guile
  guile> (use-modules (foo foo))
  guile> (foo-version)
  "0.0.1"
  guile> (quit)

Congratulations!  Your new package works.  The `foo-version' procedure
is implemented in the C file foo.c for demonstration purposes.

This is release 0.0.1 of guile-sdl.              -*- text -*-

guile-sdl is a compiled Guile module that ...

Please send bug reports to <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de>.


Getting Started ======================================================

1. Make sure that you have a recent (January 2001 or later) CVS
   version of Guile installed on your system.  (You can type

     guile -c '(write-line (version))'

   in your terminal window to check which version of Guile you have:
   the output should be `1.4.1'.)  If not, see under "Obtaining
   guile-sdl and Guile" how to get it.

2. Make sure that you stand in the `guile-sdl' directory and type

     ./configure

   This will configure guile-sdl for your system.

3. Type

     make install

   to build and install guile-sdl.

   If everything went well we're ready to enter the interpreter...

4. Type

     guile

   You should now be at the Guile prompt ("guile> ").

5. Type

     (use-modules (sdl sdl))

   so that the guile-sdl module gets loaded.

6. We're now ready to try some basic guile-sdl functionality.

About This Distribution ==============================================

   Building and installing this distribution gives you:

   - a compiled library, libguile-sdl-sdl.so, which is installed in
     <prefix>/lib .

   - a Scheme file, sdl.scm, which is installed at
     <prefix>/share/guile/sdl/sdl.scm .

   - the info manual, guile-sdl.info, which gets installed in
     <prefix>/info .

   Other interesting files include:

   - INSTALL, which contains (generic) instructions on building and
     installing guile-sdl.

   - NEWS, which describes user-visible changes since the last release
     of guile-sdl.

   - COPYING, which describes the terms under which you may
     redistribute guile-sdl, and explains that there is no warranty.


Obtaining guile-sdl and Guile =======================================

   The latest guile-sdl release is always available from my Guile
   page at http://www.pintus.de/mgrabmue/guile.  This release is at
   http://www.pintus.de/mgrabmue/guile/guile-sdl-0.0.1.tar.gz.

   If you don't already have a recent (January 2001 or later) CVS
   Guile installed on your system, you also need to download and
   install this by following the instructions at
   http://www.gnu.org/software/guile.

   The mailing list `guile-user@gnu.org' carries discussions,
   questions, and often answers, about Guile.  To subscribe, send mail
   to guile-user-request@gnu.org.
