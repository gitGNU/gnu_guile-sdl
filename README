				guile-sdl 0.1.6
				---------------

  guile-sdl is a set of Guile bindings for SDL (Simple DirectMedia
Layer) to enable Guile programmers to do all the nice things you can
do with SDL.

  All the functions have been wrapped by hand (Which I later found was
a stupid thing to do, but anyway, it's been done).

  Most of the SDL functions have been wrapped with the exception of
few functions that were too C-centric. The SDL Threads and the Audio
funcions haven't been included because of the problems with Guile code
being run from more than one thread.However audio programming can be
done with the sdl-mixer module that requires the SDL_mixer
library. YUV overlay functions are not included.

  OpenGL funcions are also included but are not tested. Have a feeling
that OpenGL can be used through guileGL after getting a OpenGL surface
from SDL.

  Also included is SDL_rotozoom-1.4 (by A. Schiffler
<aschiffler@home.com>) and the bindings for them.


Requirements
------------
* Guile     (Used guile-1.6 for testing)
* SDL-1.2 
* SDL_image
* SDL_mixer (optional, required if audio support is needed)
* SDL_ttf (optional, required if truetype font support is needed)


Installation
------------
 Uses GNU autoconf, automake for building from the sources.
The only interesting option for configure is --enable-mixer=yes/no to
optionally provide support for SDL_mixer.If "no" is not specified, SDL_mixer
will be searched for in the library directories.
