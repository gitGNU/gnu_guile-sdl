This is release 0.1.0 of guile-sdl.              -*- text -*-

guile-sdl is a compiled Guile module providing an interface to the SDL
(Simple Direct Media Layer) cross-platform game programming library.

Please send bug reports to <foof@debian.org>.


Getting Started ======================================================

1. Make sure that you have a recent (January 2001 or later) CVS
   version of Guile installed on your system.  (You can type

     guile -c '(write-line (version))'

   in your terminal window to check which version of Guile you have:
   the output should be `1.4.1'.)  If not, see under "Obtaining
   guile-sdl and Guile" how to get it.

2. Make sure that you stand in the `guile-sdl' directory and type

     ./configure

   This will configure guile-sdl for your system.

3. Type

     make install

   to build and install guile-sdl.

   If everything went well we're ready to enter the interpreter...

4. Type

     guile

   You should now be at the Guile prompt ("guile> ").

5. Type

     (use-modules (sdl sdl))

   so that the guile-sdl module gets loaded.

6. We're now ready to try some basic guile-sdl functionality.
