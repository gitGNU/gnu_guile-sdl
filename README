Welcome! (or "☡ Guile ∘ SDL ∞")
===============================

	This directory contains Guile-SDL, a set of modules that provide
	bindings for SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) to enable Guile
	programmers to do all the nice things you can do with SDL.

	Most of the SDL functions have been wrapped with the exception
	of a few functions that were too C-centric.  The SDL Threads and
	the Audio functions haven't been included because of the
	problems with Guile code being run from more than one thread.
	However audio programming can be done with the module ‘(sdl
	mixer)’ that requires the SDL_mixer library.

	Also included is SDL_gfx 2.0.22 (by Andreas Schiffler) and
	bindings for it.


Requirements
============

	* Guile 1.4 or later
	* SDL 1.2
	* SDL_image
	* SDL_mixer (optional)
	* SDL_ttf (optional)


Installation Process
====================

	See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.
	Briefly:

	  ./configure [--disable-mixer] [--disable-ttf]
	  make
	  make check [INTERACTIVE=1] [VERBOSE=1] [DEBUG=1] [NOMMX=1]
	  make install
	  make installcheck

	By default, configuration tries to find the libSDL_mixer and
	libSDL_ttf libs and headers to build modules (sdl mixer) and
	(sdl ttf), respectively.  If they are not found, these modules
	will not be installed.

	If your cpu supports MMX but your compiler mishandles the
	assembly in the imagefilter functions (causing a segfault),
	you can use env var ‘IMFI_CFLAGS’ to try to work around the
	problem.  For example:

	  ./configure CFLAGS='-g -O3' IMFI_CFLAGS='-O1'

	arranges to pass ‘-g -O3 -O1’ to the compiler, which should
	set the optimization level to one (later option overrides).
	This var is marked special and is automatically re-supplied
	in config.status invocations.

	Note: The output of "./configure --help" mentions the option
	‘--disable-sdltest’.  However, that is an artifact of SDL's
	autoconf support, and is silently ignored.

	By default, "make check" and "make installcheck" run only tests
	which do not require user interaction.  You can specify
	‘INTERACTIVE=1’ to enable running these particular tests.  If
	there are problems, add ‘DEBUG=1 VERBOSE=1’ and send the output
	to the maintainer along w/ a precise description of observations
	and expectations (i.e. file a bug report).

	If the gfx test segfaults, try running it with ‘NOMMX=1’.
	(But, it could be a compiler problem, see ‘IMFI_CFLAGS’ above.)


Installation Result
===================

	Doing "make install" copies six modules (four machine-dependent
	shared object libraries and two human-readable text), and the
	documentation (info format file) to various directories under
	${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}, with the result being that the
	following modules are available:

	  (sdl sdl)
	  (sdl mixer)
	  (sdl ttf)
	  (sdl gfx)
	  (sdl misc-utils)
	  (sdl simple)

	See the output of ‘./configure --help’ for information on how to
	customize the installation directories.

	Additionally, if you have "guile-tools make-module-catalog",
	that program is run in the "site directory" to create and/or
	update the module catalog there.


Reporting Bugs
==============

	Please send bug reports to Thien-Thi Nguyen.
	Alternatively, you can file a report on Savannah.
