- 0.3.1 | 2005-01-08

  - bugfix: `make-surface' and `create-rgb-surface' no longer ignore `flags'

	These procs used to internally hardcode SDL_HWSURFACE instead of
	using the `flags' argument.

  - dropped (sdl sdl) proc: scale-surface

	This was never implemented.  Its advertized functionality was
	also redundant w/ `zoom-surface', which furthermore has the
	benefit of a more flexible interface.

  - print representation for flagstash objects now begins with "#"

	This is to follow the Scheme convention for printing objects
	that cannot be `read' back in.

  - implementation for (sdl sdl) proc: event-state
  - implementation for (sdl sdl) proc: peep-events

	Previously the interface was available but calling these procs
	resulted in a "not yet implemented" error.

  - new (sdl misc-utils) proc: copy-surface
  - new (sdl misc-utils) proc: ignore-all-event-types-except

  - new module: (sdl simple)



- 0.3.0 | 2004-11-25

  - "guile-tools make-module-catalog" no longer invoked unconditionally

	If your Guile installation does not provide this program, that's
	ok; Guile-SDL will still build.  However, in that case the
	wrapper script `wily-guile' may have difficulty finding the
	pre-installed compiled modules, which will affect "make check",
	primarily.

	For more info, see file GUILE-FIXES in the distribution directory.

  - "make install" more graceful for !HAVE_MIXER and !HAVE_TTF

	The "make install" for these subsystems, when disabled (either
	due to lack of underyling support, or through command-line
	options to ./configure), used to try to symlink files that were
	not present (see NEWS for Guile-SDL 0.2.5).


- 0.2.6 | 2004-09-01

  - docs cleanup

	The documentation methodology extracts signatures from functions
	in C source code and thus the variable name of the arguments are
	the ones displayed (unless overridden).  Previously, the vars
	were named w/ an "s_" prefix to indicate "scheme value", a mild
	form of Hungarian notation.  A particularly striking example:

	 - Scheme Procedure: create-rgb-surface s_flags s_width s_height
		s_depth s_rmask s_gmask s_bmask s_amask

	This has now been changed to read:

	 - Scheme Procedure: create-rgb-surface flags width height depth
		rmask gmask bmask amask

	The signature still occupies two lines -- unavoidable w/ so many
	arguments -- but the whole is less jarring to read (we hope).

  - info entry now under category "Guile modules"

	It used to be under "Guile".

  - "basics" series finished

	This release concludes the "basics" series which prioritized
	general methodology refinement over features.  Next series, to
	be numbered 0.3.x, is for "coverage" (see TODO).


- 0.2.5 | 2004-07-23

  - backward-compatability installation bugfix: libFOO.la symlinks

	To support the venerable "scm_init_FOO_BAR_module" method for
	loading binary modules in versions of Guile that look for a
	FOO/libBAR.la, and not simply FOO/BAR.la, appropriately named
	symlinks are now created for each installed .la file.

  - bugfix: symbolic return value for `fading-music' and `fading-channel'

	These procs used to return an integer.  Now they return a
	symbol, one of: MIX_NO_FADING, MIX_FADING_OUT, MIX_FADING_IN.

  - new (sdl misc-utils) proc: poll-with-push-on-timeout-proc

  - new (sdl sdl) proc: enumstash-enums


- 0.2.4 | 2004-06-28

  - installation change: scheme wrappers eliminated

	The module (sdl sdl) used to be a scheme wrapper for binary
	module (sdl sdl-sup).  Now it is the binary module itself.
	See README.  Also, (sdl sdl) no longer provides the procs
	`call-with-clip-rect' and `rotate-square'.

	On "make install" if file $(GUILE_SITE)/sdl/sdl.scm exists,
	it is deleted.  If the dir $(GUILE_SITE)/sdl is empty as a
	result, it is also deleted.

  - new module: (sdl misc-utils)

	Currently this contains the procs `call-with-clip-rect' and
	`rotate-square', both of which used to be available in module
	(sdl sdl).  The procs are documented in the info pages in a new
	chapter: "Miscellaneous Utilities".



- 0.2.3 | 2004-03-06

  - return value changes
    - cd-status: symbolic (was integer)
    - cd-get-nth-track: #f on error (was empty list)
    - joystick-get-ball: #f on error (was empty list)

  - new (sdl sdl) proc: string->image


- 0.2.2 | 2004-02-08

  - bug fix: module (sdl sdl) no longer loads (ice-9 syncase)

  - bug fix: roto-zoom-surface arg zoom no longer ignored

  - bug fix: all-but-last optional args now handle #f as "unspecified"

	If a procedure takes optional only one optional arg, that
	procedure has not changed.

	If a procedure takes more than one optional arg, all but the
	last of such args now handle #f the same as being "unspecified".
	To have the last optional arg be interpreted as "unspecified",
	simply omit it!

	This change was motivated to allow specification of the last
	optional arg while "not really specifying" the others.  Here is
	a list of procedures (and the optional args involved) that were
	changed, grouped by module:

    - (sdl mixer)

	open-audio -- freq format chunksize
	play-channel -- channel loops ticks
	play-music -- loops
	volume -- volume
	expire-channel -- channel
	fade-out-channel -- which
	fade-out-group -- tag

    - (sdl sdl)

	cd-play-tracks -- start-track start-frame n-tracks n-frames
	cd-msf->frames -- s f
	make-keysym -- sym
	roto-zoom-surface -- zoom
	zoom-surface -- zoomy
	blit-surface -- srcrect dst dstrect
	list-modes -- pixel-format flags

  - arity relaxation

	The last arg for some procedures has been made optional.  Code
	specifying these args still works (backwards-compatible change).
	Here is a list of procs -- all in module (sdl sdl) -- and their
	affected args:

	set-clip-rect -- rect
	set-caption -- icon
	video-mode-ok -- flags


- 0.2.1 | 2004-01-19

	This is a maintenance release (no user-visible changes).
	Basically, some sub-optimal C macrology was reworked.


- 0.2.0 | 2003-11-21

  - installation change: scheme wrappers for most modules eliminated

	Previously, the modules (sdl mixer), (sdl ttf) and (sdl gfx)
	were implemented as a combination of a small piece of Scheme
	code that dlopened a libtool-created shared object library in
	${libdir}.  Since Guile can recognize certain shared object
	libraries as modules and load them directly, these Scheme code
	wrappers are not required and thus are now no longer distributed.
	Instead, "make install" places the shared object libraries for
	these modules and their support files in directory:

		${GUILE_LIBSITE}/sdl/

	The value of ${GUILE_LIBSITE} is determined by the `configure'
	script.  Also installed in this directory is the compiled module
	(sdl sdl-sup), an internal module used by all the user-facing
	modules.  Related to these changes, if the program "guile-tools
	make-module-catalog" is available, installation invokes it for
	the ${GUILE_LIBSITE} directory for the compiled modules, and
	${GUILE_SITE} for module (sdl sdl).  See README for more info.

  - upgrade facility: make {check,clean}-000-libdir

	See README section "Upgrading Tips" for info on how to handle
	old ${libdir}/libguileSDL* files (from Guile-SDL 0.1.x).

  - "sdl-" prefix dropped

	Procedure names no longer begin with "sdl-".  You can use the
	#:renamer clause (in `use-modules' and `define-module' forms)
	to add this back, or possibly choose another prefix.  In this
	distribution, the tests, examples and documentation use "SDL:".

  - "make check" now respects INTERACTIVE env var

	Normally "make check" skips tests that require human
	interaction.  You can do "make check INTERACTIVE=1" to
	enable running those tests as well.


- maintainership transfer: ttn

	A big thanks goes to Alex Shinn, Vikram Subramanian, and Joel
	Smith, the original authors of the disparate packages that all
	came together as Guile-SDL in mid-to-late 2001, for (1) writing
	the code; (2) pooling their efforts; and (3) passing it on.


- 0.1.7

	Most of the merge complete.  Looking to make some minor clean-up
	and bugfixes before a 0.2.0 release.


- 0.1.0

	This is the very first version of Guile-SDL.
