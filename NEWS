- guile-sdl 0.2.0 (released 2003-11-21)

  - installation change: scheme wrappers for most modules eliminated

	Previously, the modules (sdl mixer), (sdl ttf) and (sdl gfx)
	were implemented as a combination of a small piece of Scheme
	code that dlopened a libtool-created shared object library in
	${libdir}.  Since Guile can recognize certain shared object
	libraries as modules and load them directly, these Scheme code
	wrappers are not required and thus are now no longer distributed.
	Instead, "make install" places the shared object libraries for
	these modules and their support files in directory:

		${GUILE_LIBSITE}/sdl/

	The value of ${GUILE_LIBSITE} is determined by the `configure'
	script.  Also installed in this directory is the compiled module
	(sdl sdl-sup), an internal module used by all the user-facing
	modules.  Related to these changes, if the program "guile-tools
	make-module-catalog" is available, installation invokes it for
	the ${GUILE_LIBSITE} directory for the compiled modules, and
	${GUILE_SITE} for module (sdl sdl).  See README for more info.

  - upgrade facility: make {check,clean}-000-libdir

	See README section "Upgrading Tips" for info on how to handle
	old ${libdir}/libguileSDL* files (from guile-sdl-0.1.x).

  - "sdl-" prefix dropped

	Procedure names no longer begin with "sdl-".  You can use the
	#:renamer clause (in `use-modules' and `define-module' forms)
	to add this back, or possibly choose another prefix.  In this
	distribution, the tests, examples and documentation use "SDL:".

  - "make check" now respects INTERACTIVE env var

	Normally "make check" skips tests that require human
	interaction.  You can do "make check INTERACTIVE=1" to
	enable running those tests as well.


- maintainership transfer: ttn

	A big thanks goes to Alex Shinn, Vikram Subramanian, and Joel
	Smith, the original authors of the disparate packages that all
	came together as guile-sdl in mid-to-late 2001, for (1) writing
	the code; (2) pooling their efforts; and (3) passing it on.


- guile-sdl 0.1.7

	Most of the merge complete.  Looking to make some minor clean-up
	and bugfixes before a 0.2.0 release.


- guile-sdl 0.1.0

	This is the very first version of guile-sdl.
