The guile-sdl distribution:                   -*- text -*-

Thanks to:

  Mike Vess, for help testing guile-sdl.

  Martin Grabmueller, for the guile-extension template from which this
  package is structured.

  Neil Jarram, from whom I snarfed the outline of the files README,
  AUTHORS, THANKS, etc.  The following statement slipped in
  transitively via Neil's guile-xlib THANKS file:

  Mikael Djurfeldt, for the style of the `Getting Started' section of
  the README file, which I have copied from his GOOPS distribution
  [now merged into Guile core].
