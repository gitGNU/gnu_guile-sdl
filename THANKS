Guile-SDL owes its existence and improvement to:

  Mike Vess, for help testing Guile-SDL.

  Martin Grabmueller, for the guile-extension template from which this
  package used to be structured.

  Alex Shinn, Vikram Subramanian, and Joel Smith, for writing Guile-SDL
  in the first place, and for passing it on to maintainers w/ more time.

  Paolo Bonzini, for libtool help.

  Paul Osmialowski, for making available ports of some Guile 1.4.x
  ‘guile-tools’ programs to Guile 1.6.x.

  Brian Templeton and Andy Wingo, for (Guile) portability ideas.

  David Thompson, for ideas and portability bug reports.
